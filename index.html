<center><h3>What We Do</h3></center>
<center><p>At the SPMS, we take in socks that have been lost or abandoned without their second half. Our mission is to help every single sock find its match, until eventually there is no need for the SPMS.</p></center>
<center><h3>The SPMS Promise</h3></center>
<center><p>We believe in no sock left behind. That's why all sock adoptions are completely free of charge and come with a microchip so they will never be lost again. Our socks are kept in heated, padded enclosures where our trained staff feeds them twice a day and ensures their enclosures are up to SPMS standard. They are given 4 hours of outside daily, and we even allow visitors to interact with them to help them adjust in a new home.</p></center>

<center><h3>Meet Some Adoptable Socks</h3></center>
<center><p>With so many socks in need of a home, we can be sure that you'll find the sock perfect for you and your family.  Feel free to call or stop by and browse some socks for adoption today!</p></center>
